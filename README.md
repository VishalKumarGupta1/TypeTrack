 # Type Track

**Type Track** is a web-based typing practice application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy by tracking words typed per minute (WPM), identifying incorrect words, and providing a summary of correct and incorrect words after completing a typing test.

## Live Demo

You can try the live version of **Type Track** here:

## Features

- **Typing Test**: Displays a random sentence or phrase for the user to type.
- **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Tracks how many words you type per minute while completing the test.
- **Error Detection**: Highlights incorrect words and provides feedback on which words were typed correctly or incorrectly.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: As you type, the app compares your input against the given sentence and shows if you are on track.

## How It Works

1. The user is presented with a sentence to type.
2. The app calculates your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
3. As you type, the app checks for correct and incorrect words, highlighting errors in real-time.
4. Once the typing task is complete, a summary is displayed with the following details:
   - **Total words typed correctly**
   - **Total words typed incorrectly**
   - **Words per minute (WPM)**

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling for the UI and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for tracking typing speed, error detection, and user interaction.
