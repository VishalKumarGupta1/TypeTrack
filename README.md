# TypeTrack
TypeTrack is a web application that measures your typing speed and accuracy. Start the typing test with a single click, and as you type, it calculates your words per minute (WPM) and shows how many words you typed correctly versus incorrectly. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, itâ€™s a simple tool to help you improve your typing skills.
